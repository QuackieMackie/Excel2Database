# This was created as a back end tool for a minecraft plugin.
This tool was created to stop forcing me to log into my vm, and pg admin whenever I needed a value edited.
It sped up the prcoess of editing values in the database, and let me do maths with the values without adding more code into my plugin.

With the current overhall of my plugin though this tool is currently not in use.
I will get back to it at some point.
